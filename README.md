# PositivityBot
A Twitter Bot that will respond to "#Positivity" (not case-sensitive) with a randomly-selected positive phrase.

In case you're wondering... keys.py is deprecated, but yours will look very similar! ;)

Feel free to add to the list of #Positivity phrases, and check out these YouTube links I heavily used to help me out!

In the future I would like to add web-crawler capabilities to remove the need for a hardcoded list. And, for me personally, a server to keep this continuously running.
